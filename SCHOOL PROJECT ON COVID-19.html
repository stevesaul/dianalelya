	<h1><center>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>Here I will be discussing and talking about the changes that have been brought about by the pandemic we are facing right now.</p><br>
	
	<h1><center><u>Covid-19</u></h1>
	<p><h4> The corona virus or covid-19 is a communicable respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that causes illness in humans.<br>
	Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan China, but now  it has spread throughout the world.</h4><br>

	</p>
	<center><h3><u>HOW IS IT</u></h3></center>
	<Center><h3><u>SPREAD?</u></h3></center>
	<ul>
<li>The disease spreads from one person to another though infected air droplets that are projected during <em>coughing or sneezing</em></li>
<li>It can <em>also</em> be transmitted when humans have contact with hands or surfaces that contain the virus and touch their <strong>eyes,<br>
	nose, or mouth</strong> with the contaminated hands. </li><br>
</ul>
	<h4>However there are ways to ensure you do not get this virus. A few are:</h4>
<ol>
	<p><li>Washing your hands frequently.</li>
	<li>Not touching your face.</li>
	<li>Always cover your mouth when you cough or sneaze.</li>
	<li>Staying home.</li>
	<li>Follow the governments directives.</li></p>
</ol>

<h2> Effects of the virus.</h2>
<p><em>Without a doubt</em> this pandemic has affected our daily lives in very many different ways.<br>
First off, it is now unsafe to leave the house to meet others, <strong>especially</strong> at public gatherings.<br>
A few examples of those public gatherings are:
 <ul>
 <li>Weddings:-<br>
 Many people have not been able to attend their loved ones weddings seeing as it is now a health hazard to have a gathering of more than 20 people.<br>
 The ceremony now only includes the bride, the groom and each of their parents.</li>

 <li>Funerals:-<br>
 Families all over the world cannot bury the loved ones they lost properly since the ceremonies must now become much more <strong>brief</strong> and are attended by <strong>much less</strong> people so as to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.<br></li>

 <li>Church services:-<br>
 Churches have been closed for the <em>first time since nearly 1918</em>, when the spanish flu put the world at a standstill.</li>

 <li>School:-<br></li>
 schools have also had to be shut down seeing as it would be nearly <em>impossible</em> to continue to maintain social distancing at such a large gathering.<br>
 Ever since the disease found its way to Kenya classes have been forced to move online. It has been about five months since the new classes began.<br>
This has been a new experience and a very huge shift to go from normal, physical, school to the virtual online classes.<br>
</ul>
